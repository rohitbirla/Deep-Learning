### Write a program to implement the AlexNet model (Note : You can use any publically available dataset for testing). While implementing you have to show following things:
  Display sample input and output images (at least 10 images).
 Display the total images in the database, size of the image, no of classes in the
database.
 Display the first convolution function kernel filter coefficient values
 Display the training accuracy / training error
 Display the testing accuracy

### 2. Write a program to implement the new CNN model. The model should contains following
